## Goals
- Review existing prompt engineering best practices and techniques to large language models (LLMs)
- Apply the prompt engineering for a classification task
- Evaluate the results and iterate based on the findings
- Discuss the limitations and next steps

## Review prompt engineering techniques
Many prompt engineering techniques have been explored in order to understand how to write an effective prompt for LLMs to produce a desired output for users.

Some universal best practices have been mentioned in many different sources. For example:
- OpenAI guidance <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api">here</a>
- FlowGPT guidance <a href="https://guide.flowgpt.com/engineering/1basics/2general-tips">here</a>
- Learning prompt guide <a href="https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro">here</a>
- Prompt engineering guide <a href="https://learnprompting.org/docs/intro">here</a>

FlowGPT also introduced a couple frameworks on how to structure a prompt with different components. For example:
- **Elavis Saravia framework**: The prompt will include the following 4 components: instruction, context, input data, and output indicator.  
- **CRISPE framework**: The prompt will include the following 5 components: capacity and role, insight, statement, personality, and experiment.

Additionally, prompt optimization tools such as <a href="https://promptperfect.jina.ai/">PromptPerfect</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/automatic-prompt-engineer">Automatic Prompt Engineer</a> (Zhou, et al., 2023) can directly produce an optimized prompt based on the user input.

In this project, I will apply these existing prompt best practices, techniques and frameworks on a classification task that will be introduced in the section below. And then evaluate the effectiveness and discuss the next steps.

## Classification task introduction


## Experimenting different prompting techniques to classification
Due to cost, all the experiments in this project is using GPT 3.5.

## Results


## Discussion: Prompt Library or Prompt as a service
